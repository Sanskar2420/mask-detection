# mask-detection
Here I am working on a mask detection project using Computer Vision.


here i dont have uploaded my dataset.For making a mask-detection model you have to tarin model with your own dataset which consist with mask images and without mask images.
And as per your changes in saving code you have to update code for example if you are changing directory for any file you have to update path in given code for specific directory.
